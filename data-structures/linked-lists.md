# Linked Lists

Non-contiguous list-based data structure
- allows for data to be allocated in smaller chunks, meaning data is stored more efficiently.
- must follow references to memory addresses to iterate through the list, more costly to iterate

- Singly-linked list behaves like a stack, so its easy to implement a stack using an adt
