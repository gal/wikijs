<h1>Binary Trees</h1>
<p>A tree is a connected undirected simple graph with no cycles.</p>
<p>A binary tree is a rooted tree in which:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Every node has at most 2 children.</li>
  <li>The children of a node are ordered from left to right.</li>
</ul>
<p>The depth of a binary tree is the length of the longest path from the root node to a leaf node.</p>
<h2>Rooted Trees</h2>
<p>We assume there is a root.<br>A rooted tree is a tree with one vertices designated the root, and all edges directed away from it.</p>
<h3>Describing vertices in a rooted tree</h3>
<p>If there is a directed edge from x to y, then x is the parent of y, and y is the child of x.<br>If y and w have the same parent, they are siblings of each other.<br>A vertex with no children is a leaf. A vertex with children is an internal vertex.<br>The ancestors of v are all the vertices from v to the root except for v.<br>The descendants of a vertex v are all the vertices that have v as an ancestor.</p>
<h2>Binary Tree Node</h2>
<ul>
  <li>element</li>
  <li>leftchild</li>
  <li>rightchild</li>
  <li>optional: parent</li>
</ul>
<h3>Height of a node</h3>
<p>The height of a node is the length of its longest directed path to a leaf.</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">height(node) = 0    # If node is a leaf
height(node) = 1 + max(height(left), height(right))</code></pre>
