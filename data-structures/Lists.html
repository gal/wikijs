<h1>Lists</h1>
<h2>Everything in Python is an object</h2>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">x = 3    # x references the object 3
y = 3    # y references the same object
z = y    # z references the same object
y = 4    # y now references the object 4</code></pre>
<h2>User defined classes and objects</h2>
<p>Each time we create an object from a class, Python creates a new object in memory (Python decides where it is stored):</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">c1 = Card(3, 3)
c2 = Card(3, 3)    # Different object</code></pre>
<h2>Python Lists are array-based lists</h2>
<p>A list in Python is a sequence of references to objects. The references in the list are maintained in a contiguous physical block in memory, packed one after another in sequence - called an array-based list.</p>
<p>Each index in the list references objects stored elsewhere such as 4 or “4”</p>
<h2>Tuple</h2>
<p>A tuple is a sequence of references to objects. A Tuple is immutable. Implementation is similar to Lists, but is able to take advantage of being immutable.</p>
<h2>Space &amp;Time Complexity</h2>
<p>The amount of space required for the list depends on the number of elements, not the space required for the basic objects.</p>
<h3>Searching for an element</h3>
<p>Finding an element in a list takes O(n), where n is the length of the list</p>
<h3>Increasing list size</h3>
<p>If there is space at the end of the list, use it.<br>Appending items to a list may require reservation of new area in memory for the entire list, and time to copy the list elements across.</p>
<p>For a list that may grow to size n, naïve append take O(n<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<p>Policy: Each time we must grow the list, double its size.<br>Doubling the size each time space is needed takes O(n) to build a list of size n.<br>Average cost of a single append is then O(1).</p>
<h3>Popping an element</h3>
<p>For a list of length n,&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; pop(i) takes (n-1-i) copies.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; pop(0) takes n-1 copies<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; pop is O(n)</p>
<h2>Operations</h2>
<h3>Immutable</h3>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">x in s
x not in s
s + t
s * n     # Add s to itself n times
s[i]
s[i:j]
s[i:j:k]    # Slice of s from i to j with step k
len(s)
min(s)
max(s)
s.index(x)
s.count(x)
</code></pre>
<h3>Mutable</h3>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">s[i] = x
s[i:j] = t
del s[i:j]
s[i:j:k] = t
del[i:j:k]
s.append(x)
s.clear()
s.copy()
s.extend(t)
s.insert(i, x)
s.pop([i])    # Retrieves item i and removes it
s.remove(x)
s.reverse()
</code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
